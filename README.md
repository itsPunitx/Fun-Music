# 🎹 Piano Music

A simple and fun web game to spread love and creativity!  
Press any key to play a **romantic piano track** 🎼 while beautiful **love messages** softly appear and fade away on your screen.  

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Any key press** → Plays a romantic piano track + shows a random love message in the center.  
- Messages appear magically and **fade out slowly**.  
- The piano track plays **fully once**; pressing more keys during playback adds more messages (music won’t restart).  
- When the track ends, pressing another key will start it again.  
- **Press `ESC` anytime** → stops the music and clears all messages instantly.
